## The Breakout

Bitcoin crossed the $90,000 threshold in early Asian trading on Tuesday, touching a high of $91,240 before consolidating around $90,500. The move came after seven consecutive days of positive ETF inflow data, culminating in a record $1.24 billion single-day inflow into US spot Bitcoin products.

## ETF Flow Analysis

Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, cumulative inflows have exceeded $45 billion. BlackRock's IBIT alone now holds over 285,000 BTC, making it one of the largest single-entity Bitcoin holders globally.

**Weekly flow breakdown:**
- **BlackRock IBIT**: $640M
- **Fidelity FBTC**: $310M
- **ARK/21Shares ARKB**: $180M
- **Bitwise BITB**: $110M

## Technical Picture

The $85,000–$87,000 range served as a springboard after holding for three weeks. With the breakout now confirmed on high volume, technical analysts are targeting the $95,000–$100,000 zone next.

Key levels to watch:
- **Support**: $88,500 (former resistance, now support)
- **Target 1**: $95,000 (Fib extension)
- **Target 2**: $100,000 (psychological + chart target)

## What's Next

The Bitcoin halving narrative — reducing block rewards from 3.125 to 1.5625 BTC in April 2028 — remains a longer-term tailwind. Near-term, traders will watch Fed minutes on Wednesday for any revision to rate expectations, which could provide the next directional catalyst.
