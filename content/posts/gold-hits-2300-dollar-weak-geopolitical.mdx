## The Historic Break

Gold spot (XAU/USD) surged through the $2,300 level on Tuesday, touching an all-time high of $2,321 before profit-taking capped the initial move. The rally comes as the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped below 103 — its lowest level since December.

## Three Forces Driving the Rally

### 1. Central Bank Accumulation
Global central banks purchased a record **1,037 tonnes** of gold in 2024, led by China, Poland, Turkey, and India. This "demand floor" under the market has fundamentally changed gold's supply/demand dynamics.

### 2. Dollar Weakness
The DXY's break below 103 removes a key headwind for dollar-denominated commodities. If the Fed begins its easing cycle in Q3 as expected, the dollar could see further weakening.

### 3. Geopolitical Premium
Elevated risk in the Middle East and ongoing Russian-Ukraine conflict are sustaining a geopolitical risk premium in precious metals that may persist for years.

## Technical Targets

| Level | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Current | $2,321 |
| Target 1 | $2,400 |
| Target 2 | $2,500 |
| Key Support | $2,250 |

The monthly chart shows clean breakout structure with no significant chart resistance above $2,321. The next major psychological level is $2,500.
