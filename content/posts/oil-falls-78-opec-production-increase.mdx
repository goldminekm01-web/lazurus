## The Shock Decision

In its most surprising policy shift in three years, OPEC+ voted to increase collective production by 500,000 barrels per day beginning April 1st. The decision, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, reversed the group's previous commitment to maintain cuts through year-end.

Brent crude responded immediately:
- **Brent**: -3.2% to $78.40
- **WTI**: -3.5% to $74.80
- **Energy ETF (XLE)**: -2.8%

## Why Now?

### Market Share vs. Price

Analysts point to three key motivations:

1. **Market share defense**: US shale production has surged to a record 13.3 million bpd, eating into OPEC's market share. The cartel appears to have concluded that defending price creates more production incentive for non-OPEC producers.

2. **Iraq and UAE compliance issues**: Both countries have been producing above their quotas. Rather than discipline them, the cartel appears to have accommodated the overproduction.

3. **Geopolitical signaling**: The timing — ahead of potential US Iran sanctions re-engagement — suggests a political dimension to the supply-side messaging.

## Impact on Inflation Narrative

For the Fed, lower oil prices are a meaningful disinflationary signal. Energy comprises approximately 7% of core CPI, and a 10% oil price drop typically reduces headline CPI by 25–30 basis points over a 3-month lag.

This development modestly supports the case for Fed rate cuts in H2 2025.

## Technical Levels

| | Level |
|--|--|
| Key support | $75.00 (H2 2024 range floor) |
| Major support | $70.00 (multi-year pivot) |
| Resistance | $82.50 |
