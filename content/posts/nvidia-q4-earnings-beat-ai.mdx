## Headline Numbers

| Metric | Q4 Actual | Consensus | Beat % |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Revenue | $22.1B | $18.7B | +18.2% |
| Data Center Rev | $18.4B | $15.6B | +17.9% |
| EPS (adj.) | $5.16 | $4.42 | +16.7% |
| Gross Margin | 74.6% | 73.2% | +140bps |

## The Blackwell Ramp

The headline story is the Blackwell architecture transition. CEO Jensen Huang described Blackwell shipments as "extraordinary" with customer demand exceeding supply in multiple configurations.

> "Every cloud provider, every sovereign government, every enterprise is building their own AI infrastructure. Blackwell is the platform for the next decade of computing." — Jensen Huang, CEO

Key Blackwell data points:
- Backlog extends to **Q3 2025** for flagship H200 variants
- B100 and B200 variants entering volume production in Q1 2025
- GB200 NVL72 rack systems fully booked through mid-year

## Hyperscaler Spend: An Arms Race

The five largest cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Oracle) collectively announced over **$350 billion in capex** for 2025, with AI infrastructure comprising the majority. This gives Nvidia extraordinary revenue visibility.

The competitive landscape remains Nvidia's to lose:
- **AMD MI300X**: Gaining share in price-sensitive segments, but benchmarks trail H100 on LLM workloads
- **Google TPUs / AWS Trainium**: Strong for proprietary models, limited third-party appeal
- **Intel Gaudi 3**: Marginal presence in production workloads

## Valuation Reality Check

At 34x forward earnings and a $1.7 trillion market cap, the bar is extraordinarily high. Any hiccup in capex from hyperscalers — recession risk, regulation, or competition — would reprice the stock significantly.

**Bull case**: AI training spend grows 5x by 2027; NVDA maintains 70% GPU market share → $900+
**Bear case**: AMD/custom silicon take 20%+ share; capex cycle peaks in 2025 → $400–$450
